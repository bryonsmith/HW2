		Hello, my name is Bryon.  I am a student at the University of Iowa.  I grew up in Iowa City and went to Senior West High school, where I graduated in 2002.  In 2003, I joined the <a href="https://www.army.mil/"> Army </a> and went to a lot of places.  I traveled to Korea, Iraq, Kuwait, and many different states.  I got out of the army in 2009 and moved my family back to Iowa City.  I went to <a href="http://www.kirkwood.edu/"> Kirkwood Community College </a> and obtained my A.A. in Liberal Arts in 2011.  In 2013, I transfered to <a href="https://uiowa.edu/"> the University of Iowa </a>.  In 2014, I got into the <a href="https://tippie.uiowa.edu/"> Tippie College of Business </a> where I am majoring in Business Analyitics and Information Systems &lpar;BAIS&rpar;.  After I graduate in 2017, I want to go into the cyber security field to help protect customers information. </p>
